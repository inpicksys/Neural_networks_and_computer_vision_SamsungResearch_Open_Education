# Neural networks and computer vision
## Samsung Research Open Education

##  Motivation
How the thinking model implemented in neural networks is organized. How neurons simulate logical algorithms. And how large networks are built on their basis. The seminar will take you through the basics of computing in PyTorch, Python-library for neural network development.

## What aboute course

In this course we will go through the basics of neural networks: how some abstract model of thinking, placed in a computer, allowed ordinary programmers to just take, and solve the previously unsolved problem of vision robots. We will learn the architecture and algorithms of neural network configuration, acquire a deep understanding of everything that happens after clicking "Start training". We will understand how to better present the task for a neural network, as not all statements are in principle solvable, and the method of maximum plausibility will help us.

But it's still not computer vision. In this part of the course you will immerse yourself in the convolution neural networks, the methods of regularization and normalization that make real problems solvable.

In addition to lectures, there are eight workshops waiting for you. You will gain experience in machine learning and computer vision tools, solve basic tasks, and be ready for practical testing, where you will solve a serious problem in the field of CV/ML. And if you do, you will be able to get a certificate with honors.
